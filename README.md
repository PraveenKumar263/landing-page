# Bootstrap Landing Page

This project is built with React based on the Bootstrap Landing Plate template (https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-landing-page).

The project has 8 main components :

1. Nav Bar
2. Header
3. Features
4. Image Showcase of Features
5. Testimonials
6. Call To Action
7. Footer

The Features component renders object found in FeaturesData.json, while the Testimonials renders object based on reviews.json dynamically. More testimonial or features can be added easily by ammending the json file.
